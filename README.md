# Java OpenGL (JOGL) Geometry Drawer (Geo-Draw)

### About

The Geo-Draw was a project of mine that I wrote in order to learn how to use OpenGL with Java. I had great ideas going into the project, but I learned, through online communities like Stack Overflow, that development for JOGL has slowed and possibly stopped all together. Therefore, after running into some bugs that pretained to key-bindings and JOGL, I deemed taht I got what I wanted out of the project and went onto something else. 

Definitely looking back I should have begun straight in C++ as that is where native OpenGL programming is truly done. Nonetheless, I learned a lot about the basics of graphic design and am looking to start something in the future that heavily expands onto deeper topics of OpenGL.

### How to run?

You must compile and run with the "Required Libraries" in order for everything to be successful.

### What does it look like?

This application wasn't anything special. It was simply an exercise to learn how to use OpenGL in Java. Below is a screenshot of what it looks like. I tried creating animated gifs to show the rotation animation the elements are doing on-screen, but the animated gifs came out choppy so if you'd like to run it then run the provided jar file :)
