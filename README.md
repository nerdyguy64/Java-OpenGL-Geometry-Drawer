# Java OpenGL (JOGL) Geometry Drawer (Geo-Draw)

### About

The Geo-Draw was a project of mine that I wrote in order to learn how to use OpenGL with Java. I had great ideas going into the project, but I learned, through online communities like Stack Overflow, that development for JOGL has slowed and possibly stopped all together. Therefore, after running into some bugs that pretained to key-bindings and JOGL, I deemed taht I got what I wanted out of the project and went onto something else. 

Definitely looking back I should have begun straight in C++ as that is where native OpenGL programming is truly done. Nonetheless, I learned a lot about the basics of graphic design and am looking to start something in the future that heavily expands onto deeper topics of OpenGL.

You must compile and run with the "Required Libraries" in order for everything to be successful.

### What does it look like?

This application wasn't anything special. It was simply an exercise to learn how to use OpenGL in Java. Below is a screenshot and an animated gif to demonstrate what it can do.

The main world polygon (the rotating figure) was constructed with 3 sub-triangles.
